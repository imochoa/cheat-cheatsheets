# To list every process on the system:
ps aux
NOT THE SAME AS `ps -aux`, WHICH SHOULD NOT BE USED!

# To list a process tree:
ps axjf

# To list every process owned by foouser:
ps -aufoouser

# To list every process with a user-defined format:
ps -eo pid,user,command

# Exclude grep from your grepped output of ps.
# Add [] to the first letter. Ex: sshd -> [s]shd
ps aux | grep '[h]ttpd'


To see every process on the system using standard syntax:
    ps -e
    ps -ef
    ps -eF
    ps -ely 
To see every process on the system using BSD syntax:
    ps ax
    ps axu 
To print a process tree:
    ps -ejH
    ps axjf 
To get info about threads:
    ps -eLf
    ps axms 
To get security info:
    ps -eo euser,ruser,suser,fuser,f,comm,label
    ps axZ
    ps -eM 
To see every process running as root (real & effective ID) in user format:
    ps -U root -u root u 
To see every process with a user-defined format:
    ps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm
    ps axo stat,euid,ruid,tty,tpgid,sess,pgrp,ppid,pid,pcpu,comm
    ps -eopid,tt,user,fname,tmout,f,wchan 
Print only the process IDs of syslogd:
    ps -C syslogd -o pid= 
Print only the name of PID 42:
    ps -p 42 -o comm=

# STAT: Process State Codes

Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a process.
- `D`: Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
- `R`: Running or runnable (on run queue)
- `S`: Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
- `T`: Stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced.
- `W`: paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
- `X`: dead (should never be seen)
- `Z`: Defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent. 

For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:
- `<`: high-priority (not nice to other users)
- `N`: low-priority (nice to other users)
- `L`: has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
- `s`: is a session leader
- `l`: is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
- `+`: is in the foreground process group
