# Correct permissions for keys
sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh
sudo chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_example.pub
sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_example

# lastly your home directory should not be writeable by the group or others (at most 755 (drwxr-xr-x))

# Adding keys
1. Start the agent
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566

# Depending on your environment, you may need to use a different command. For example, you may need to use root access by running sudo -s -H before starting the ssh-agent, or you may need to use exec ssh-agent bash or exec ssh-agent zsh to run the ssh-agent.
# Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519


# Put something from a remote server into your machine
ssh -L 27017:localhost:27017 ignacio@spandev

# Mounting a remote file system using sshfs
```
# Install if required
sudo apt install sshfs

# Create the target dir (does not have to be under /mnt)
sudo mkdir <local path>
# e.g. sudo mkdir /mnt/target

# Mount!
sudo sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions <user>@<host>:<remote path> <local path>
